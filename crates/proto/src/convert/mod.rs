//! Lossless conversion between the `api` types and the generated wire
//! types, split by the same domains the `api` crate uses. Each module owns
//! both directions for its types and the round-trip test that guards them:
//! every `api` value must survive api -> proto -> api unchanged.
//!
//! The functions are re-exported flat, so callers stay on `convert::name`.
