# The Kopuz daemon API

Kopuz's playback core is a daemon. Every feature the built-in GUI has goes
through the gRPC surface documented here, so a frontend in any language with
protobuf support is a first-class citizen. The contract is one file:
`crates/proto/proto/kopuz.proto` (package `kopuz.v1`). Copy it, generate
stubs for your language, connect.

Current API version: `1` (reported by `Kopuz/GetStatus`).

## Running the daemon

Two deployment shapes serve the same API:

- **Headless**: run `kopuzd`. It owns the audio engine, the SQLite library,
  the configured source, scan/sync jobs, scrobbling, and OS media
  integration (MPRIS/SMTC/Now Playing). No window, no webview. Build it with
  `cargo build --release -p kopuz-daemon --features kopuzd --bin kopuzd`.
  A systemd user unit ships in `packaging/systemd/kopuzd.service`.
- **Embedded**: the desktop app can serve the identical API from its own
  process (Settings, General, "Remote Control API"). This exists because
  SQLite is single-writer: `kopuzd` and the GUI must never run against the
  same library at once, so a frontend that wants to attach while the GUI is
  open attaches to the GUI itself.

`kopuzd` flags: `--bind 127.0.0.1:0` (default: loopback, ephemeral port),
`--token <hex>` (default: random), `--db-path <file>`.

## Discovery and auth

Whichever process serves the API writes a discovery file with `0600`
permissions:

- Linux: `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/kopuz/daemon.json`
- macOS: the user cache dir, `~/Library/Caches/kopuz/daemon.json` (the
  exact path is logged at startup)

```json
{ "port": 49312, "token": "6f2c…", "pid": 74211 }
```

Every RPC needs the token as metadata, constant-time checked:

```
authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The connection is plaintext HTTP/2 on loopback. If you bind a LAN address
you are trusting that network with your library and the bearer token;
prefer an SSH tunnel. Server reflection (v1 and v1alpha) is served without
auth so `grpcurl` can list the schema:

```sh
grpcurl -plaintext 127.0.0.1:<port> list kopuz.v1.Kopuz
grpcurl -plaintext -H "authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  127.0.0.1:<port> kopuz.v1.Kopuz/GetPlayerState
```

## Errors

RPC failures are gRPC statuses. The stable machine-readable Kopuz code
rides the `kopuz-error-code` response metadata; localize by that code,
never by message. The gRPC code is the nearest standard equivalent:

| kopuz-error-code | gRPC code | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `invalid_input` | INVALID_ARGUMENT | malformed request or out-of-range position |
| `unauthorized` | UNAUTHENTICATED | missing/invalid token |
| `source_auth_expired` | UNAUTHENTICATED | the media server needs a re-login |
| `not_found` | NOT_FOUND | unknown key/id |
| `conflict` | ABORTED | a single-flight job of that kind is already running |
| `unsupported` | UNIMPLEMENTED | this daemon runs without that service |
| `source_unreachable` | UNAVAILABLE | the media server did not answer |
| `internal` | INTERNAL | daemon-side failure |

Structured details, when present, are JSON in the
`kopuz-error-details-bin` metadata. A failed mutation fails its own RPC with
that status, so ordinary gRPC error handling applies. Unknown codes must be
treated as `internal`; the set can grow.

## Events and playback

Playback commands are ordinary unary RPCs: `Play`, `Pause`, `Toggle`,
`Next`, `Previous`, `Stop`, `Seek {position_ms}`, `SetVolume {0..1}`, and
`SetMode {shuffle?, loop?}`. Each returns `MutationResult {rev}`, where
`rev` names the state revision containing the command's effect, so you can
wait for your mirror to catch up before trusting it.

`Kopuz/Subscribe` is the event stream, one server-streaming RPC per client.

- **`SubscribeRequest.after_sequence`** is the resume cursor: the highest
  event sequence you saw before a reconnect, or 0 to start at the current
  live position. The daemon replays newer events from a 512-event ring, or
  sends one `resync` event when the gap is too old; then live events flow.
  On `resync`, refetch `GetPlayerState` and your queue window.
- **Events** arrive in an `EventEnvelope` with a monotonic `sequence` (your
  next resume point). The synthetic `resync` envelope uses sequence `0` and
  does not advance the cursor. The kinds mirror the state machine:
  `player_state` (full snapshot on every transition), `position` (new
  anchor after seek/pause), `buffered`, `queue_changed`,
  `library_invalidated {table, generation}`, `job_progress`,
  `job_finished`, `config_changed`, `source_status`, `notice`,
  `resync`.

Two rules make a frontend feel native:

- **Position is an anchor, not a ticker.** `PlayerState.position` is
  `{ms, at_ms, playing}` and `now_ms` is the daemon clock at send time.
  Compute a clock offset once and interpolate locally while `playing` is
  true. The daemon does not stream per-second ticks.
- **`intent` vs `phase`.** `phase` is engine truth; `intent` is what the
  daemon is trying to do. Render optimistic UI from `intent` (show the
  pause glyph while a track is still loading), exactly like the built-in
  GUI. While `fading` is present, keep displaying `fading.track` and drive
  the seek bar from `fading.position_ms`.

## Unary RPCs

| rpc | request | returns |
|---|---|---|
| `GetStatus` | | `{version, api_version, uptime_secs}` |
| `GetPlayerState` | | `PlayerState` snapshot |
| `GetQueue` | `Page {offset, limit}` | play-order window `{rev, total, items: [{index, track}]}` |
| `GetTracks` | `TracksRequest {filter, page}` | `{total, offset, items: [TrackInfo]}` |
| `GetFolderTracks` | `{prefix, page}` | same shape |
| `GetStats` | | `{listen_counts: {uid: count}}` |
| `GetLyrics` | `{key}` | `{plain?, synced: [lines with word timing]}` |
| `GetFavorites` | | `{refs: [key], generation}` |
| `GetJobs` | | `[{id, kind, state, phase, current?, total?, message?, error?}]` |
| `GetDownloads` | | `{keys}` of offline-available tracks |
| `GetConfig` | | `{config_json, locked_keys}` (credentials stripped) |
| `SetQueue` | mode + context (+ `start_index`/`shuffle` for replace) | `MutationResult {rev}` |
| `EditQueue` | `jump {index}` / `move {from, to}` / `remove {index}` (play-order indices) | `MutationResult {rev}` |
| `SetFavorite` | `{key, favorite}` | optimistic; a rejected remote push reverts and emits a `notice` |
| `StartJob` | `{kind}` (scan / library_sync / favorites_sync) | `{job_id}`; single-flight per kind, ABORTED on conflict |
| `CancelJob` | `{id}` | |
| `StartDownloads` | `{keys}` | `{job_id}` |
| `RemoveDownload` | `{key}` | |
| `PatchConfig` | RFC 7396 merge patch as JSON in `merge_patch_json` | updated view; credential keys refused, `locked_keys` are pinned by a managed settings layer |
| `GetArtwork` | one of `track`/`album`/`artist`, plus `hq` | a stream of `ArtworkChunk` (first chunk carries `content_type`); thumbnails resized daemon-side (400px, 1920px hq) |

Queue **contexts** materialize daemon-side, so "play this album" never
round-trips a track list through the client: `tracks {keys}`, `album {id}`,
`artist {name}`, `genre {name}`, `playlist {id}`, `filter {TrackFilter}`,
`radio {station_id, stream_id}`.

`TrackInfo`: `key` (stable ref, use it for queueing/favorites/artwork),
`uid`, `title`, `artist`, `album`, `album_id`, `duration_ms?`, `khz`,
`bitrate`, `track_number?`, `disc_number?`, `kind` (normal/radio),
`seekable`, `artwork?` (an opaque hint that artwork exists; fetch bytes
via `GetArtwork`), `offline`.

## Minimal client (Python)

```sh
pip install grpcio grpcio-tools
python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I proto --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=. proto/kopuz.proto
```

```python
import json, os, pathlib
import grpc
import kopuz_pb2 as pb
import kopuz_pb2_grpc as rpc

disc = json.loads((pathlib.Path(os.environ.get("XDG_RUNTIME_DIR", "/tmp")) / "kopuz/daemon.json").read_text())
channel = grpc.insecure_channel(f"127.0.0.1:{disc['port']}")
stub = rpc.KopuzStub(channel)
auth = (("authorization", f"Bearer {disc['token']}"),)

state = stub.GetPlayerState(pb.Empty(), metadata=auth)
print(state.track.title if state.HasField("track") else "nothing playing")

print("toggled at rev", stub.Toggle(pb.Empty(), metadata=auth).rev)

for envelope in stub.Subscribe(pb.SubscribeRequest(after_sequence=0), metadata=auth):
    print(envelope.sequence, envelope.event.WhichOneof("kind"))
```

## Capability caveats

- A daemon built without a service answers UNIMPLEMENTED for its RPCs
  instead of lying; probe once and hide the feature. The GUI's embedded
  server currently runs without the config-write and downloads services
  (the GUI owns those); `kopuzd` serves everything.
- Browser frontends need a grpc-web proxy in front of the daemon; the
  daemon itself speaks plain gRPC only.
- Browser-based sign-ins (YT Music, Apple Music, SoundCloud, Spotify)
  cannot complete on a browserless box; local files, Jellyfin,
  Subsonic/Navidrome, and Nextcloud need nothing but the daemon.
- Spotify playback is machine-bound to a browser with Widevine next to the
  GUI; a headless `kopuzd` cannot play Spotify audio itself.
